# NetInput

Netinput acts as a workaround for current MAME limitation with user inputs in Linux.
It allows to use multiple mice with one MAME instance (using 2 computers).
It allows to use the same keyboard on several instances of MAME.

Netinput consists of 2 scripts, a server script and a client script.

- Server

It's called `netinput.lua`. It's configured through the NETINPUT_ADDR environnement variable. It's loaded in MAME through the `-autoboot_script` command line.

- Client

It's called `netinput_client.py`. It uses Python and the PyGame library:

Install PyGame:

pip3 install pygame

PyGame version must be greater than 2.0.0

It's configured with JSON file. Some samples configuration files are provided in this repository.

Note that NetInput client grab input. To release this grab, push ESC key.


- Virtua Formula: Using the same keyboard for multiple MAME instances

Running 2 linked MAME instances:

`NETINPUT_ADDR=0.0.0.0:54321 mame vformula -window -nomaximize -nohttp -nomouse -cfg_directory cfg1 -nvram_directory nvram1 -comm_remotehost 127.0.0.1 -comm_remoteport 15122 -comm_localhost 0.0.0.0 -comm_localport 15121 -comm_framesync -autoboot_script netinput.lua -autoboot_delay 0`

`NETINPUT_ADDR=0.0.0.0:54322 mame vformula -window -nomaximize -nohttp -nomouse -cfg_directory cfg2 -nvram_directory nvram2 -comm_remotehost 127.0.0.1 -comm_remoteport 15121 -comm_localhost 0.0.0.0 -comm_localport 15122 -comm_framesync -autoboot_script netinput.lua -autoboot_delay 0`

(One of those instance muste be configured as "Master" in F2 menu inside MAME. The other must be "Slave")

Running NetInput client:

`./netinput_client.py vr.json vr2.json`

From now, when the NetInput has the focus, you could use keys described in JSON files (arrow keys and keypad arrows) to control both MAME instances.

- Point Blank: Using multiple mice with one MAME instance.

Running Point Blank on computer 1 (with IP = 192.168.0.1, see JSON file to change this)

`NETINPUT_ADDR=0.0.0.0:54321 mame ptblank -autoboot_script netinput.lua -autoboot_delay 0`

Running NetInput client on computer 2:

Note that the provided JSON files uses 192.168.0.1 as server address. You may have to change this on your personnal network.

`./netinput_client.py ptblank.json`

You can now control the first cursor with computer 1's mouse, and the second cursor with computer 2's mouse.
